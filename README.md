## How It Works

### Daily Quote Selection
The website uses a deterministic algorithm based on the day of the year to ensure everyone sees the same quote each day:
- Calculates the current day of the year (1-365/366)
- Uses this as an index to select from the quotes array
- Same quote is guaranteed for all visitors on the same date

### Chat System
- **Client-Side Only**: No server required - runs entirely in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Messages are saved to the browser's local storage
- **Daily Reset**: Each day gets its own set of messages
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Old message history is automatically removed after 7 days

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Breakpoints at 768px and 480px for optimal viewing
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Readable typography at all screen sizes
